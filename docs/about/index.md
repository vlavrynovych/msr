# About MSR

Learn about the history, philosophy, and vision behind Migration Script Runner.

## [Origin Story](origin-story)

The personal journey from a 2017 Firebase prototype to a modern migration ecosystem vision.

**Part 1: The Story**
- The anxiety of working with production data before launch
- Building the first solution and the relief it brought
- Six years of learning from other tools' limitations
- The 2023 rediscovery: "Why reinvent the wheel?"
- Finding an unexpected collaborator in AI
- The vision for a migration ecosystem hub

**Part 2: The Technical Evolution**
- Code comparisons: 2017 JavaScript vs 2023 TypeScript
- Architectural transformation to database-agnostic design
- Key decisions and their reasoning
- What makes MSR different from traditional tools

**Built from scar tissue**: The fear of data corruption, rigid tools, and the realization that migration tools should bend to your needs, not the other way around.

## [Design Philosophy](philosophy)

The principles behind MSR's architecture, explained without the history.

**Core Principles:**
- **Database Agnosticism** - One migration runner for all databases
- **Polyglot Migrations** - SQL and TypeScript/JavaScript in one project
- **Built-in Safety Nets** - Automatic backups before every run
- **Programmable Architecture** - Inject your services and business logic
- **Custom Validation** - Enforce your team's rules automatically
- **Library-First Design** - Structured results, not process exits
- **Execution Summary** - Machine-readable output for CI/CD
- **Cloud-Native Config** - Environment variables following 12-factor principles

**Design Trade-offs**: Conscious choices between flexibility vs simplicity, type safety vs ease of use, and database-agnostic vs optimized.
