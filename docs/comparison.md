# How MSR Compares

Migration Script Runner takes a unique approach to database migrations, combining the best ideas from across the ecosystem with some innovations of our own.

## Our Philosophy

MSR is designed for **production safety, developer experience, and flexibility**. We believe migration tools should:
- Provide multiple ways to accomplish tasks (TypeScript AND SQL)
- Give visibility into what's happening (dry run, execution summaries)
- Support both development and production workflows
- Stay out of your way when you don't need them

## Feature Highlights

### What Makes MSR Unique

| Feature | MSR | Typical Tools |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| **Hybrid Migrations** | ✅ Both TypeScript & SQL | Usually one or the other |
| **Generic Type Safety** | ✅ Database-specific types (v0.6.0) | Limited or none |
| **Metrics Collection** | ✅ Built-in collectors (v0.6.0) | Usually custom |
| **Multi-Format Config** | ✅ YAML, TOML, XML, JSON, JS (v0.6.0) | Limited formats |
| **Transaction Management** | ✅ Configurable modes with retry (v0.5.0) | Basic or none |
| **Environment Variables** | ✅ Full 12-factor config (v0.5.0) | Limited |
| **Dry Run Mode** | ✅ Built-in, free | Often paid/enterprise only |
| **Execution Summaries** | ✅ Detailed success/failure logs | Basic output only |
| **Lifecycle Hooks** | ✅ Process, script, backup, transaction (v0.5.0) | Rare |
| **Flexible Rendering** | ✅ Table, JSON, Silent modes | Fixed format |
| **TypeScript-First** | ✅ Full type safety | Varies |

### Core Capabilities

| Multi-Format Config | ✅ v0.6.0 - YAML, TOML, XML, JSON, JS |
| Transaction Support | ✅ v0.5.0 - Configurable modes, isolation levels, auto-retry |
| Environment Variables | ✅ v0.5.0 - 33 MSR_* variables |
| Rollback | ✅ |
| Connection Validation | ✅ v0.4.0 |
| Programmatic API | ✅ |
| Multi-Database | ✅ PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite |
| Migration Tracking | ✅ |
| Backup Integration | ✅ |
| TypeScript Support | ✅ |

## Common Migration Tool Patterns

### JavaScript/TypeScript Ecosystem

**Knex.js** - Query builder with migrations
- Strengths: Mature, flexible, good locking mechanism
- Best for: Projects already using Knex for queries

**TypeORM** - ORM with migration support
- Strengths: Tight ORM integration, auto-generation
- Best for: TypeORM users who want unified tooling

**Prisma Migrate** - Schema-first migrations
- Strengths: Modern DX, schema drift detection
- Best for: New projects, Prisma users

**Sequelize** - ORM with migration CLI
- Strengths: Established ecosystem, multiple dialects
- Best for: Sequelize users

### Other Ecosystems

**Flyway** (Java) - SQL-first migrations
- Strengths: Simple, SQL-focused, enterprise features
- Best for: Java projects, teams that prefer SQL

**Liquibase** (Java) - Change tracking with multiple formats
- Strengths: Enterprise features, XML/YAML/SQL support
- Best for: Complex enterprise requirements

**Alembic** (Python) - SQLAlchemy migrations
- Strengths: Python integration, autogenerate
- Best for: Python/SQLAlchemy projects

**Rails Migrations** (Ruby) - Convention over configuration
- Strengths: Excellent conventions, schema dumping
- Best for: Rails applications

**golang-migrate** (Go) - Minimal migration library
- Strengths: Simple, no magic, multiple sources
- Best for: Go projects

## When to Choose MSR

MSR is a great fit when you:

- ✅ Want flexibility to use TypeScript OR SQL migrations
- ✅ Need production-ready safety features (dry run, summaries)
- ✅ Need reliable transaction management with automatic retry
- ✅ Deploy in containers/Kubernetes with environment variable config
- ✅ Value developer experience and type safety
- ✅ Want lifecycle hooks for custom logic
- ✅ Need multi-database support in one tool
- ✅ Prefer programmatic control with optional CLI
- ✅ Want a tool that doesn't force you into an ORM

## When to Choose Something Else

Consider other tools if you:

- Already heavily invested in an ORM (TypeORM, Sequelize) and want tight integration
- Need automatic migration generation from schema changes
- Prefer pure SQL with no code (Flyway, Liquibase)
- Want a schema-first approach (Prisma)
- Need enterprise governance features (Liquibase Enterprise)

## Design Decisions

### Why Both TypeScript and SQL?

Different teams have different needs:
- **Development teams** often prefer TypeScript for type safety and IDE support
- **DBAs and ops teams** often prefer SQL for reviewability and control
- **MSR supports both** so you can choose what works best for each migration

### Why Dry Run Mode?

Testing migrations before production is critical but often requires:
- Cloning production databases
- Manual testing workflows
- Hoping things work the same

**MSR's dry run mode** (v0.4.0) shows exactly what will change before applying anything.

### Why Execution Summaries?

When migrations fail in production, you need to know:
- What succeeded before the failure?
- What was the exact error?
- How do I recover?

**MSR's execution summaries** (v0.4.0) provide a detailed trace of every step, making debugging and recovery straightforward.

## Latest Release: v0.6.0

Version 0.6.0 brings enhanced type safety, metrics collection, and multi-format configuration:

- 🛡️ **Generic Type Parameters** (#114) - Database-specific type safety with `<DB extends IDB>` throughout the API
- 📊 **Metrics Collection** (#80) - Built-in collectors for observability (Console, Logger, JSON, CSV)
- 📄 **Multi-Format Config** (#100) - YAML, TOML, and XML configuration file support
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible loader system with optional peer dependencies
- 🎚️ **Log Level Control** - Configure output verbosity (error, warn, info, debug)
- ⚠️ **Breaking Changes** - Type parameters required for all interfaces + constructor signature changed

See the [v0.5.x → v0.6.0 Migration Guide](version-migration/v0.5-to-v0.6) for upgrade instructions.

## Previous Releases

**v0.5.0** brought production-grade transaction management and cloud-native configuration. See [v0.4.x → v0.5.0 Migration Guide](version-migration/v0.4-to-v0.5) for details.

**v0.4.0** brought SQL migrations, dry run mode, and execution summaries. See [v0.3.x → v0.4.0 Migration Guide](version-migration/v0.3-to-v0.4) for details.

## Future Roadmap

Upcoming features we're considering:

- **CLI Commands** (#59) - Full command-line interface
